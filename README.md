# patch-mst-debian-jessie-3.16.0-4-amd64
This is the patch to get DisplayPort 1.2 MST working with the debian jessie kernel 3.16.0-4-amd64

First of all thanks to :
- Dave Airlie (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~airlied/linux/log/?h=drm-i915-mst-v3.16) for the patch
- Jouke Waleson (https://tech.mendix.com/linux/2014/09/06/debian-testing-kernel-3.16-displayport-mst/) for the instructions

You just have to download this patch and follow instructions provided by Jouke on his post.

On my side patching the kernel allowed me to properly use the Dell docking station (and connect my 2 monitors and have 2 separate displays) with my Dell Latitude E7450.
